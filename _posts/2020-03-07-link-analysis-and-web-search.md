This is a summary of Chapter 14, "Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasonging about a Highly Comnnected World"

### Authority and Hub
Say we make a query "Common Lisp"(I love Common Lisp~), there are authoritive sources on this topic, such as wiki's page. We call such pages as authorities. On the other hand, there are also pages that are hand-compiled lists of links to authorities on specific topic; we call such pages as hubs. Good hubs point to good authorities, and vice versa. Here comes to rules:
1. authority update rule
2. hub update rule
